A very contagious virus has struck your country. Fortunately you can help Peppe beat it with reasoning and science. Or at least you can try your luck.

Click on the boxes to get the gears of politics running. Make a decree by clicking on Decret-o-matic, taking full responsibility for the effects. Will you get the expected result? You will find out the next day. If the result was not as expected you can always delete decrees by selecting them and then clicking on the bin. Every day you can do three actions: creating a decree costs one action, deleting a decree costs two actions. You do not have to use up your three actions: by clicking on "Day" you will skip to the next day.

Will you be able to keep the number of cases below 500k before the 14 days are over?
